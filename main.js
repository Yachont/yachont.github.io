console.log("sup");

// thinking of wether to use onclick button in js or html (https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp), but html is easier to see what function is being executed. so this does nothing. remove and optimize.
// document.getElementById("create-example-function");

function clgHi() {
  console.log("Hi!");
}
